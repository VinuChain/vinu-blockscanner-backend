    # Please note this is the max amount of rewards available for distribution. The actual amount is scaled
    # down based on locking period of individual stakers and the real amount distributed by the SFC contract
    # will be lower in most cases. The remaining reward tokens after the scaling are effectively also burned
    # and removed from the total supply, but this process is not reflected in this aggregated approximation.
    # Please see the current Fantom SFC contract implementation for the rewards distribution details.
    rewards: Long!
